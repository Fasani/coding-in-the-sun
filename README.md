# Coding in the Sun!

> A light high contrast theme for [Visual Studio Code](http://code.visualstudio.com).

You can have the most colourful and prettiest theme in the world, but if you can't see your code it's useless! Give this theme a try next time you are sat outside!

During the #COVID19 lockdown, I was spending time outside coding on my balcony. I put this theme together to use while coding in the Sun!
